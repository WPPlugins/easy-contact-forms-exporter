This plugin extends the already existant Easy Contact Forms and allows users to export the data collected in the forms to CSV.

== Description ==

This plugin extends the already existant Easy Contact Forms and allows users to export the data collected in the forms to CSV, allowing administrators to query the data in external tools, for Mail Merge and other technologies.

This plugin simply adds a main menu to the admin side of your WordPress installation to enable you to select the form you wish to export data from. Pressing submit then produces your CSV file for download.

Once downloaded you can manipulate your data however you wish.

== Installation ==

Use the wordpress builtin installer, or extract the zip file to your /wp-content/plugins/ directory, then activate it.

NOTE this plugin REQUIRES easy-contact-forms
